# Personal Website

My website is currently being hosted on Oregon State's server and can be accessed here:

## Project Description

This was my very first full web project incorporating HTML/CSS/JS I attempted. It's definitely not the best and there is a lot of room for improvement, but through trial and error and reading various resources I learned a lot of new things and found places where I can improve.

The website is a portrait of some of my projects I have made which can be found here, as well as a little bit about me.
