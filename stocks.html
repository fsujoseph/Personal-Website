    This project serves as a useful tool for keeping track of your yearly dividend totals. Once I graduated, I took an
    interest in the stock market, beyond just your standard 401k. I liked to calculate the dividends I would be getting
    per year based on my current portfolio. It's simple enough to calculate, but when you have a lot of stocks, your
    share prices change, the price changes, and the dividend total changes, it becomes very tedious to recalculate.
    This is where my project comes in. It is able to scrape live stock prices from the web to get up to date information.
    From there, it takes into account your portfolio and calculates the expected dividend totals! It's a simple tool,
    but is very useful and saves time. That's what I like about the project; it illustrates how computers can
    make a tedious task simple. Eventually I will design a GUI with Tkinter to make the interface more friendly instead
    of just a command line.
