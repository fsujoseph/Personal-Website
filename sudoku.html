  <p class="description">
    This project was made with the use of a backtracking algorithm. The algorithm attempts to go as far forward as
    possible, then retreats when it hits a dead end to the last valid square and tries the next number. In this way
    it 'probes' forward which drastically reduces the time complexity! However, it is still an NP-Complete problem and
    has no efficient solution. The program also creates random boards with difficulty levels, which is something I
    spent a lot of research on. It's hard for the computer to objectively say what is hard and not hard. Generally
    the less amount of numbers you have in the beginning makes the puzzle harder, but that's not always the case
    based on how they are laid out. Overall I enjoyed working on this project as I had to spend a lot of time
    learning and researching things on my own about Sudoku.
